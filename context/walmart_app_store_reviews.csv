fee50a30-2305-4e43-8886-dd3933d6649d,"Amazing how my review keeps disappearing. This is #3. According to several employees Walmart has contracted the app out to another company. They all say that it is completely broken. It no longer helps you shop in the store. The 2 shopping choices are: shopping online or for pickup or delivery. If you do find the price scanner, it won't tell you the price, instead it adds it to your cart. Walmart has also tried to help you shop by removing ALL of the price check stations in the store.",1,9,1594184484000,,,Walmart

On the website it will show items in our cart but the app shows no items in the cart. If I add an item from the app it doesn't show up in the website cart.

It will tell you something is or if stock if you hit delete and continue you will be sent back to the start of checkout. If you look back through your cart the item your deleted is still there. If you choose to find a replacement the app still shows the item in stock.

Seems USPS likes to open/snoop at any packages. I'm complaining about it here in the hopes that there are more out there, and maybe Walmart will use more reliable carriers. Overall, as long as the pickers pack everything properly, and you order a minimum of $35. it's a great deal. Sometimes, better than in store.",4,39,1647504326000,,,Walmart

I was okay with that as long as it was convenient for me and benefitted me as well. My husband and I both shop but the savings catcher was only on my phone. So scanning in receipts worked.

If I wanted shipped I would have chosen ship and not delivery. Then they delivered the wrong order only to tell me to take this order back to the store for a refund. I think not.

I was able to get my money back (after a bunch of hassle) but until they improve their security I won't be risking it. Also they don't have a way to make a list to go shop in-store, lots of things don't list a price, and the prices are higher in the app than in person. They have a TON of out-of-stock stuff.

I can't price check anything anymore (even manually), I can't even add things to a created list unless i actually go to website. Smart idea but horrible execution.

Walk halfway across the store to find someone to give you a price is ridiculous. Not to mention, the stuff in clearance is almost always unpriced, or not the price it says. There were plenty of items I wouldn't buy at the sticker price, but I would scan and realize it had been marked down significantly and would then buy. Now I don't give it a second look.

So, I can't track my purchases.

Express shipping, I didn't need so you really have to check & double check before submitting orders. Taking more money than what is spent and reserving it really doesn't make sense to me.

But my recent experience with a delivery has lead me to believe that it is hard to reconcile errors when your order is missing or flat out incorrect. You can speak to a live agent and still get nowhere just like in the actual store. I feel that all items ordered should be returnable even if they are the incorrect items or substitutes.

We have both uninstalled the app and reinstalled and still have the same issues. Has been this way for over a week. Hoping it will get fixed at some point but not sure what the issue is,1,11,1721764827000,,,Walmart

I got sick of calling for refunds, so I just put it in garbage. same with chopped up onions already have the rotten smell. Everything else has been great. I love ordering from WM+ especially cause I don't drive anymore, too expensive. And really nice whenever it's 100° plus outside.",5,0,1723006187000,"Quality is our foremost concern, Rod.

90b4d145-9d6d-4ee9-9f09-9a6af6e8a8e9,placing my first online grocery order was simple and easy to understand. choosing replacements were a great help as well as choosing not to replace the items! I do wish the delivery times were closer to the order time instead of hours out! Outside of a faster turn around time the process was smoothe!,5,3,1721617810000,,,Walmart
8eee5590-8453-4686-bf15-a9c7fb3fe0ca,I only on line shop when absolutely necessary I've been hacked a few times in the last couple of years. this wasn't my easy experience it took me a while and they keep pushing so many other items after selecting the items you need and also when you make your reservation for delivery time they seem to want to push the express service on you which course extra Walmart has pretty good prices I've been at Walmart customer for many years in other states. I wish there was more items made in America,3,1,1722662860000,Your review is important to us. Please reach out to https://survey.walmart.com/app with more details.,1722664178000,Walmart

Order more, keep in stock; it's obvious that others like this product too. Theyre not only safe but taste really good.
